## Credits

This project was completed as part of an Online Course on Udemy titled
**_The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!_** The website's
user interface was designed by the course instructor, **Jonas Schmedtmann**, and
students had to implement some of the website's features using Javascript. Still, Jonas
guided students all the way through the implementation by providing walkthrough videos.
Therefore, I would like to thank Jonas for his tremendous commitment to his students
and for giving us this great project.
